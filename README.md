# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

A predictive analysis project developed in **Jupyter Notebook** to determine the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes. This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to train on historical health data and predict disease presence with high accuracy.

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection through predictive analytics can help improve treatment outcomes. In this project, various ML classification algorithms are applied to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more.

## 📈 Sample Results

- Achieved up to **90%+ accuracy** with ensemble models like Random Forest.
- Found strong correlation between features like `cholesterol`, `cp (chest pain type)`, and `thalach` (max heart rate) with heart disease risk.
- Logistic Regression provided good baseline performance.
